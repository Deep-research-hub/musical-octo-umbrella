I've built the Deep Research Hub—a fully functional web app that simulates advanced deep research workflows! It features customizable research depth (quick/medium/deep), niche selection (Web3 gaming, trees/environment, AI, general), and a special Potentia Ludi preset that automatically configures optimal settings for your gaming wallet research. The app simulates multi-step research (search → analyze → cite → verify), displays a real-time progress log, calculates accuracy scores with hallucination risk assessment, identifies pain flags like missing verification or limited depth, and shows time saved metrics. You can export complete reports as JSON or text files. The dark-themed, responsive design makes it easy to prototype research flows before building real integrations—perfect for testing what your users or AI agents would need from a deep research tool!
